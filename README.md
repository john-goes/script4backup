# script4backup
Creates a backup of a whole directory or a single one.

### - why?
It can be useful when you if you1 want to edit the config file in Linux but have to copy it in some weird directory and name it to minimize the risk of losing it.

### - okay, but seriously, why?
It's been a while since I don't post something here. When I felt the need of this kind of script, I just created and decided to share. (after some technical ping pong)

### - you know that can be done simply by using rsync, right?
Yes I do. No, I don't care.
